As above, so below
Dismantled piece by piece, what's left will not decease
As within, so without
The seasons bring relief
Let me live and die in peace
I will be consumed, returned into the earth
Only passing through, nothing left to hold on to
Like the thaw against the snow, into the undertow
Cut the chord and cast me out
Cast me out
It's a promise that you cannot break
Was your life worth dying for?
The universe survives on give and take
Death is an open door
It's a promise that you cannot break
Was your life worth dying for?
The universe survives on give and take
Decay is the only law
As above, so below
Dismantled piece by piece, what's left will not decease
As within, so without
The seasons bring relief
Just let me live and die in peace
It'll wear you down, through skin and bone
It's as if my mind has a mind of it's own
It'll wear you down, through skin and bone
It's as if my mind has a mind of it's own
When my heart skips two beats
(I am hidden deep. Fast asleep)
The sea will part, where oceans meet
Finally complete
It's a promise that you cannot break
Was your life worth dying for?
The universe survives on give and take
Death is an open door
It's a promise that you cannot break
Was your life worth dying for?
The universe survives on give and take
Decay is the only law
Swan song
A declaration of endlessness
I swear I will not look back, as I return into the black
When the veil lifts, how will I know?
How will I know?
Will I see God?
As above, so below
Dismantled piece by piece, what's left will not decease
As within, so without
The seasons bring relief
Just let me live and die in peace
