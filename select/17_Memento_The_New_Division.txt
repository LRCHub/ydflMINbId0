Sometimes I need something to keep reminding me
About the countless types of possibilities
I've got a brand new car, a brand new watch but I
I don't remember buying any one of these

I live a whole new life with a wife in fantasy
She takes a pill just to feel what I'm like on ecstasy
And then she walks outside in the cold, and pouring rain
But I've always wanted, always wanted out

So tonight, I'll be alive...
