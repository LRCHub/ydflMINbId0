# Mori Calliope – Memento

```
So just how far could I go
I think I already know
That view that I wanna see
A place in history that's mine
I don't know why we're
Always side by side, but worlds apart
It's trial by fire
I'm fighting for a place where we can breath
When spite takes over
I might just take it out on you
Cuz you're
Too good to be true
Struggling but carrying on
I'll go where nobody has gone
I'm searching again and again and again
For something only I can do
Asking why
I can't be someone else
Despite it all my mind has become my hell
With no escape
Or hope in the dark
But still in my heart
Your words echo over and over
I'm finally letting go, but I can't erase you
I'm following behind, but I won't chase you
I'm swallowing my pride until the time that I
can face you
I thought that it was love in the perfect
lighting
It's never been enough, but I'll keep on writing
A story
That's evolving
From the day that I decided I'm alone
I don't belong anywhere anymore, it was my
decision
I'm gonna break down the door to your heart
without your permission
There was nothing that could make me stay
Remember it like it was yesterday
Hanging onto every word you'd say
What if I'd walked away?
How can I still carry on
Someday when you're finally gone?
I'm searching again and again and again
For something only I can do
The truth is
I can't be someone else
Despite it all my mind has become my hell
With no escape
Or hope in the dark
But still in my heart
My words echo over and over
I'm finally letting go, and you can't erase me
Cuz I'm the only one that could ever replace me
Igniting every line until the time that I can
face me
I thought that it was love in the perfect
lighting
It's never been enough, but I'll keep on writing
The story
That evolved me
It's today that I'm deciding I'm alright
So just how far could I go?
I think I already know
The view that I wanna see
I still could make it in time
